'''
consider a function rev which reverses the digits in an integer.
Here are some examples:
rev(103) = 301
rev(2400) = 42
rev(9) = 9

Given an array of non-negative integers arr, your task is to count the number of pairs (i, j)
such that i â‰¤ j and arr[i] + rev(arr[j]) = arr[j] + rev(arr[i])

Sample input and output

for A=>[1,20,2,11],
output is 7
2.for A [4,8,20,3,10,18,5,0,13,13]
output is 21

Algo is rearrange the equation to arr[i] - rev(arr[i]) = arr[j] - rev[arr[j]]
create nums which stores arr[i] - rev(arr[i])
use hash_map to store the frequency
use nc2 formula to calculate the result

here since i <= j we need to include arr lenght
