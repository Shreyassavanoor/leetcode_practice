# Problem: Given two integer arrays, a and b, as the data needs to be queried.
# and given an array of queries, each query maybe one of the two forms below:

# modify query: [0, i, x] means we need to assign b[i] with the value of x. donâ€™t need to return anything
# calculate query: [1, x] means we have to find the total number of pairs in a and b such that a[i] + b[j] = x. (for all i and j)
# Return an array of integers where each element represents the count of pairs that sum to x returned by each calculate query.
# Duplicate numbers should be counted.
